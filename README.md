# Fingerprint Attendance System

This is a fingerprint-based employee attendance system developed during my internship. It integrates a biometric fingerprint SDK with a real-time web-based front end.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Backend**: C# (.NET Framework), Fingerprint SDK
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript
- **Database**: [Mention DB used, if any – e.g., SQL Server or MySQL]
- **Deployment**: Local server (or specify if hosted)

## 💡 Features

- Fingerprint scanning using a biometric SDK
- Real-time attendance display on a web interface
- Auto-refresh and dynamic update of attendance status
- Logged time tracking per employee
- Lightweight and efficient UI

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User places finger on the biometric scanner
2. Fingerprint SDK processes and authenticates the fingerprint
3. Attendance details are sent to the backend
4. Web interface updates in real-time with attendance status

## ⚠️ Note on SDK

This project uses a proprietary fingerprint SDK which is **not included in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.

If you're interested in replicating this project or testing it, please contact the SDK provider or use a compatible open-source biometric SDK.

➡️ The code is modular, and the SDK-dependent logic is abstracted to allow replacement if needed.
